**Step 1**: Open terminal on your computer and type:

`ssh <CNetID>@midway2.rcc.uchicago.edu`

You are now on the RCC cluster.

**Step 1a**: (Optional) You can type in the command for extra compute now

`sinteractive -p broadwl --mem=25G --time=36:00:00`

**Step 2**: CD to your content analysis folder on RCC
	
`cd Content-Analysis-2020`

**Step 3**: Load the Anaconda module

`module load Anaconda3/5.3.0`

**Step 4**: Use this command to find your IP address

`/sbin/ip route get 8.8.8.8 | awk '{print $NF;exit}'`

**Step 5**: Launch Jupyter on RCC with this command using the IP address you got in Step 4

`jupyter-notebook --no-browser --ip=<ip address>`

You should get a URL that you can copy and paste on your local browser.
