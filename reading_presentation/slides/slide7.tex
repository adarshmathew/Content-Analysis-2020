H1a & Network diversity is positively associated with receiving more diverse information and more total non-redundant information   \\ \hline
H1b & Network diversity is associated with lower channel bandwidth                                                                  \\ \hline
H1c & Channel bandwidth is positively associated with receiving more diverse information and more total non-redundant information   \\ \hline
H2a & The greater the information overlap among alters, the less valuable structural diversity will be in providing access to novel information \\ \hline
H2b & The broader the topic space, the more valuable channel bandwidth will be in providing access to novel information             \\ \hline
H2c & The higher the information refresh rate, the more valuable channel bandwidth will be in providing access to novel information \\ \hline
H3  & Access to non-redundant \& diverse information is positively associated with individual performance                           \\ \hline
