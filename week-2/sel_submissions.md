 ## This is why you can't get laid

Because you're rude to people who annoy you online. Women sense these things, they can look at you and deduce by reading your facial expressions that you're the type of person who'd tell them to fuck off when they comment on reddit to offer their point of view "as a woman." Because you'd call her male best friend a cuck and tell her he's jerking off thinking about her and she can only enjoy that fact when she's technically unaware of it, now you ruined the fun. 

It's also cause you don't want her friendship. If you want to get laid you should want to be her friend. But if you want to be her friend, you shouldn't want to have sex with her, you should be happy that you can enjoy and admire the precious person she is without having any use of it. If you don't want to do that, this is why  you can't get laid. If you do want that then you're good and totally deserve to get laid by some hypothetical other female some time in your future maybe. But remember you're not entitled to it. You only deserve it if you don't think you deserve it. But why would any woman think you deserve her if you yourself don't believe that you do? Have confidence. Be dominant and go for what you want, grab them by the pussy. Well, no, don't do that. But do approach women, if you don't approach women this is why you can't get laid. Just don't approach them because you want sex, when women know you're mainly interested in them for sex they feel objectified even though you can't possibly know much else about them at that point that would be an incentive to approach them. But that is your problem, that is why you can't get laid, because a lot of men actually do approach these women on a daily basis just because they noticed their intelligence and sense of humor from across the room. 

Women are, above all, people. You need to treat them like regular people. Like you'd treat any random guy you encounter. If that means minding your own business and leaving them alone assuming that if they need something from you they'd let you know, this is why you can't get laid. How many women did you approach in your lifetime? Do you know how to talk to women? You talk to women like you talk to any other person. You impress her with your passions, ambitions and hobbies. You entertain them, make them laugh, give them compliments but also keep them interested, you have to fascinate them, show them what you have to offer, advertise yourself, display confidence, attract with your body language, take initiative, put yourself out there, prove your worth, while she looks good and giggles occasionally. You know, like any other conversation you'd have, she could easily be an unattractive dude and the script wouldn't change, right?

To attract a woman you need hobbies. It doesn't matter what they are, women just need to see you're passionate about something. Unless it's gaming, forums, passionately jerking off to porn, anime, comics...  no wait, there are girls who like these things. How will you know when you find one, no worries, she'll tell you and every other guy who encounters her. She already has an army of white knights who convince her that a personality like hers is something that only occurs once per millennium, and to think it comes with those tits assures her divine status. So don't bother, she only wants to recruit you. Back to less special snowflakes, yeah, your hobbies aren't hobbies, so you need to change that and improve yourself by becoming passionate about things that don't interest you. 

You should also be ambitious. Not like, ambitious to get 100,000 karma. Ambitious means rich. Don't call them gold diggers, this is why you can't get laid. It's not about money at all, it's about proving you can be a good provider and displaying passion for your work because the time you spend away from her working is really one of the most essential parts of your relationship. 

Women are not asking for much. They just want to be treated like anyone else. They are your equals, they are not better or worse than you. You can treat them the way you would like to be treated by them, you can be honest with them and open with them. You can just be yourself, that's the key. You don't have to try to be someone you're not. You don't have to pretend or fake things, you don't have to play games. Just how men are different so are women and some women will think you're great for who you are, will be impressed by your interests cause they share them, will like your mindset cause they think like that too.... 
If this is what you hoped for, this is why you can't get laid.

The court date is set for November 8th. 
 

## 100% GUARANTEED CURE TO INCELDOM - [FEMOIDS HATE THIS ONE SECRET!!]

Rope
 

## Why can't girls see past the fact that I'm an autistic nice guy?

Why does it matter that I am 700 pounds and flap my hands?  Can't they see that I can multiply 3 digit by 3 digit numbers in my head?
 

## In case this sub gets nuked...

I just wanna say I love you guys. I felt utterly alone until I discovered this place. This sub actually helps me cope. Thank you to all the truecels and the mods. 

Whatever happens, I'm sure we'll find a new home. <U+0001F378>
 

## Brutal realization: Women actually enjoy watching ugly men suffer in dating

If women wanted to end our suffering they would say "you are ugly, you have no chance with women, focus on other things in life".

Instead they say "work on your personality" or "I'm sure there's someone out there for you". They want to see you try and fail because it's what they love. They love watching ugly men struggle in dating.

Don't feel bad about hating women, because they hate you too.
 

## I love you guys

Without you guys I would have already brought out the rope. You guys keep me alive and when this sub gets banned one day I will have to bring out the rope again unless there's a quick alt sub
 

## Femoids lurkers be like: "You guys do realise that average/ugly girls exist?"

Yep and you are just as stuck up and privileged as Stacy:

-  You get complimented and asked out regularly.

- You get your dating inbox filled.

- Treat your looks match (sub 6) like trash.

 You have it as good as Stacy but because you can't secure a Chad like she can that's why you think dating is "hard!" Ask out your looksmatch and watch that "struggle" disappear.
 

## Every woman claims she was raped or sexually harassed in her past

They are advertising their desirability to Chad. 
 

## I will Die A Virgin

In 1-2 months time. I will order the necessary materials soon and then it will be over.
